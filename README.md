# MoveUI

___
A mod designed for custom UI elements to be displayed on the players screen, and give them the ability to move those UI's around on thier screen.

The best way to show off this mod is with a video so here ya go:

Heres also a couple picture of the current UI's I have available:

## CargoNotifier
Tired of getting stopped by the local faction because you forgot you had that suspicious cargo left in your hold?
Well no more, for this UI will display 4 separate alerts when carrying: Illegal, Suspicious, Dangerous, or Stolen Cargo.

Remember with all these UI's they can be Moved, Enabled, Disabled, or even restricted to specific situations (coding skill required)

I look forward to everyone feedback, and I welcome ideas for more UI's that I can add.

## INSTALLATION
___
1. Download the zip file
2. Drag and Drop the contents into the /Avorion/ directory,
All files are inside their own /mods/ directory except for ONE file.
server.lua needs to be altered to load the initial player file.
IF YOU HAVE AN ALTERED SERVER.LUA DO NOT COPY THIS FILE OVER
you'll want to open the file and copy over the ONE LINE over to your server.lua

## Note
___
I wanted to also notify other modders that this mod and all my future mods/patchs will be using this new file structure.
After discussing it with several other modders including koonschi himself, its been agreed upon that a separate directory mimicing the main data directory will be the best approach.
I encourage all modders to adopt this file structure as default, as its likely to became standard possible required for future mods, when avorion supports steam mods.
